YouTube, the world’s third most popular online destination, has transformed from a video-sharing site into a job opportunity for content creators in both new and mainstream media. (cite: https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/communications/journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/2017/06/06_Margaret_Holland.pdf) Individuals who upload videos on Youtube, also known as YouTubers, could turn on monetization features. One of the major ways YouTubers earn money is through the number of ad views (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857?hl=en). Since ad views depend on each video’s views, we would like to analyze what factors could result in a high view and how people’s preferences have changed in recent years.
